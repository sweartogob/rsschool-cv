3. Right now I'm doing web development training, in the future I plan to study deeper js or go to optimize digital currency. 
I have experience with graphic design. I had to create banners, menus, various ads for street-food cafe, also I made some custom websites. 
I was trained at the school of additional education in Russia - "Kvantorium", in the group of robotics for several years. At this school I was trained not only in engineering, but also in programming in similar C++ programming languages, learned English for programmers, and passed the stages of learning the skills necessary to work in a team
